# How to port from player animator

## The basics
In player animator you use a `KeyframeAnimationPlayer` to play a `KeyframeAnimation`, but each `KeyframeAnimationPlayer` can only play one animation before having to be discarded, so you usually register an `AnimationLayer` or `ModifierLayer` to the player animation stack to hold the current animation player.  

In PAL though you can simply register a `PlayerAnimationController` and play animations using it as shown in the how to play animations section. (You can even chain animations so they play back to back using the `PlayerRawAnimation` class!)  

An animation controller can also hold modifiers so while the `AnimationLayer` and `ModifierLayer` classes still exist in PAL you probably won't need them.  

TLDR:  
`KeyframeAnimationPlayer, AnimationLayer, ModifierLayer` -> `PlayerAnimationController`  
`KeyframeAnimation` -> `Animation`

## Modifiers
First of all modifiers now give you an instance of `PlayerAnimBone` instead of various vectors per bone, but I assume you will get the hang of that quickly. :)  
All bone names are now in snake case so for example `left_arm` instead of `leftArm`.  

There are some other serious changes when it comes to the values in modifiers though, so here is a list:  
* Player animator uses metres/block for body positions unlike all other bones, but PAL now also uses pixels for it for the sake of consistency
* The Y pos axis for every bone is negated except the body bone
* The Y and X rot axes are negated for the body bone
* All the rotation and position axes are negated for items
* The X and Z position and rotation axes are negated for capes
* The Z and Y position and rotation axes are swapped for items

All these changes are for achieving consistency between how all the different bones operate, more specifically consistency with how they work in Blockbench.
